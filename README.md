## **Features**

- **Dynamic Tracking System**: Search and filter simulations based on their real-time status, allowing users to monitor running simulations and identify issues instantly.
- **Personalized Simulations**: Users can create and manage custom simulations by adjusting parameters to meet specific research needs.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: The platform provides real-time insights into the simulation's performance, allowing for adjustments and resource allocation during runtime.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Tools for analyzing simulation results and generating in-depth insights based on performance data.
- **External Interface Integration**: Seamless integration with external systems for running simulations and retrieving results, ensuring smooth interoperability between different tools.

## **Problem Addressed**

Simulation systems are widely used in various research fields to study and model real-world phenomena in controlled virtual environments. However, the **lack of comprehensive management systems** creates inefficiencies, including:
- Long experiment cycles due to manual simulation management.
- Difficulty in tracking real-time performance and adjusting simulations on the go.
- Limited tools for in-depth analysis of simulation results.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Backend**:
  - **Python**: Main programming language for backend logic.
  - **FastAPI**: Web framework for building the API.
  - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing simulation and user data.
- **Frontend**:
  - **TypeScript**: For writing the frontend logic.
  - **React**: Framework for building the user interface.
  - **Redux**: For managing application state.
- **Integration**:
  - **External Interface**: Communicates with external systems to run simulations and fetch results.
  - **Docker**: Used for managing the MongoDB instance.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Backend**: 
  - Python 3.x
  - MongoDB (via Docker or local installation)
- **Frontend**: 
  - npm (Node Package Manager)
- **External Simulation Interface**: The external interface required to run the simulations must be installed and configured separately. This interface handles the actual execution of simulations and is integrated with the platform to ensure smooth operation.(Send me a message and I'll send a direct download link)
